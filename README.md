## About the Project
---
It's a simple project I made while doing preadvising. The open credit system can be somewhat hectic at times. Even if you have a course tree, you need to check that manually and find the courses that you have been unlocked. So being a programmer, I thought why not automate the damn thing and be done with it. Of course, that wasn't easy either ðŸ˜… But hey, at least, now I was doing something I like, right? 

It will only work for CSE students of BRACU, but feel free to pull and change up to fit your University. 

## Built with 
---
* python
* pandas 
* tkinter

## What it does
---
By inputting the courses you've done so far, you can get a list of courses you've unlocked and can choose from. 

## How to use
---
You can input the courses you've completed using
* the checkboxes
<!-- add an example -->
* a .txt file
<!-- add an example -->
* a .csv file 
<!-- add an example -->

> may show irregularities if in the input, there's a completed course whose prerequisite wasn't done. For example, if CSE221 was checked but CSE220 wasn't checked.
